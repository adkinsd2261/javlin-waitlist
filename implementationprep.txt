## 1. Dependencies & Environment

* [ ] **Environment Variable Loader**

  * Install and configure `react-native-dotenv` or `react-native-config` for `.env` support.
* [ ] **HTTP Client**

  * Husky + commitlint for commit message hygiene
* [ ] **Testing**

  * Jest setup for unit and snapshot tests
  * React Native Testing Library for component tests
* [ ] **Accessibility Automation**

  * Integrate `axe-core` CLI in CI for WCAG AA checks

---

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

* [ ] **GitHub Actions**

  * Workflow to check out code, install deps, run lint/tests, and build
* [ ] **Mock Server Smoke-Test**

  * CI step to run `npm run mock-server -- --check` and fail if errors

---

## 4. Storybook & Component Library (Recommended)

* [ ] **Initialize Storybook**

  ```bash

## 6. Documentation & References

* [ ] **Implementation Guide**: `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
* [ ] **Task Tracker**: `TASKS.md`
* [ ] **Brand Spec**: `BRAND_BIBLE.md`
* [ ] **Product Spec**: `PRODUCT_BIBLE.md`
* [ ] **Page Spec**: `CODEX.md`
* [ ] **Asset Inventory**: `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`

## 7. Final Sanity Check

* [ ] **Fresh Clone Test**

  1. Clone the repo to a new folder
  2. Follow `README.md` steps to install deps
  3. Run dev scripts (`mock-server`, `dev:android`, `dev:ios`)
  4. Run linters and tests
  5. Ensure no missing-file or missing-dependency errors
