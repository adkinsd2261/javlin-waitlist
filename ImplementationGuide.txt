# Javlin Implementation Pre-Flight Guide

Use this guide to ensure your environment and assets are fully configured before diving into feature development. Place it at the project root and refer back when kicking off each sprint.

## 1. Codebase & Environment Setup

* [ ] **Clone & Branch**

  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:your-org/javlin-waitlist.git
  cd javlin-waitlist
  git checkout -b feature/implementation
  ```
* [ ] **Install Dependencies**

  ```bash
  npm install       # or yarn install
  expo install      # if using Expo
  ```
* [ ] **Environment Variables**

  * Create a `.env` (ignored in `.gitignore`) with:

    ```ini
    API_BASE=https://api.your-domain.com/v1
    FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
    MIXPANEL_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
    ```
* [ ] **Dev Scripts Verification**

  ```bash
  npm run mock-server   # start API stub
  npm run dev:android   # launch Expo on Android
  npm run dev:ios       # launch Expo on iOS (macOS only)
  ```

## 2. CI/CD & Testing Scaffolding

* [ ] **GitHub Actions**

  * Ensure `.github/workflows/` exists for build, test, deploy jobs.
* [ ] **Linters & Formatters**

  * ESLint & Prettier configured
  * Stylelint (or Tailwind checks) for styles
  * Commit-lint for commit message consistency
* [ ] **Accessibility Tests**

  * Add `axe-core` to CI pipeline for WCAG checks
* [ ] **Unit & Snapshot Tests**

  * Jest + React Native Testing Library for components

## 3. Component Library & Storybook (Recommended)

* [ ] **Initialize Storybook**

  ```bash
  npx -p @storybook/cli sb init
  ```
* [ ] **Create stories** for each UI snippet in `CODEX.md`:

  * Waitlist form
  * Consent banner
  * Spark card with controls and badge
  * Testimonials carousel

## 4. Analytics & Monitoring Setup

* [ ] **Analytics**

  * Register Mixpanel/GA project and note token/ID

* [ ] **Error Monitoring**

  * Integrate Sentry (or Datadog) DSN in env
  * Initialize in app bootstrap code

---

## 5. Asset Placeholders & Fonts

* [ ] **Asset Placeholders**

  * Add `assets/design/placeholder.png` for any missing mockups
* [ ] **Logo & Icons**

  * Place logos in `assets/logo/` as specified in `ASSET_INVENTORY.md`
* [ ] **Fonts**

  * Ensure Google Fonts preload links in `index.html` or local files for Inter (400/500/600)

## 6. Documentation & Spec References

* [ ] **Brand & Product Docs**

  * `BRAND_BIBLE.md` v1.1 in project root
  * `PRODUCT_BIBLE.md` v1.2 in project root
  * `CODEX.md` v1.2.2 in project root
* [ ] **Task Tracker**

  * `TASKS.md` to track implementation progress
* [ ] **Asset Inventory**
